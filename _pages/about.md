Hi, I’m Ruth, a Cloud Computing enthusiast with a strong academic background in Microbiology and Biotechnology, bringing an analytical, detail-oriented approach to technology.
My journey into cloud computing began with curiosity of how technology works after working as an AI(Artificial Intelligence) trainer, which involved data annotation and labeling, data quality and validation, and AI prompt engineering and response evalution.
I later worked as a UI(User Interface) Quality assurance professional for web, desktop, and mobile applications. This also triggered my curiosity for technology and how applications are built.

I recently earned the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification through the AWS re/Start program and I'm currently building hands-on experience through cloud labs and real-world projects.
With my previous experience in the Microbiology labwork, AI training, software testing, and transcription, I have developed a strong eye for accuracy, analytical and critical thinking, ability to follow a set of guidelines, strong time management skills, quickly learning and adapting to new tools and platforms, and handling sensitive data responsibly while maintaining confidentiality.
I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and translating complex concepts into practical solutions.

I’m actively seeking entry-level cloud roles, internships, or freelance opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and continue building scalable and secure cloud solutions.
