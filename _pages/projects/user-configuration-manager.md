# User Configuration Manager (Python)

## Overview
The **User Configuration Manager** is a Python-based application designed to manage user preferences such as theme, language, notifications, and other customizable settings. The project demonstrates strong understanding of core Python concepts including dictionaries, functions, conditional logic, and string manipulation.

## Objective
To build a structured settings management system that allows users to **add, update, delete, and view configuration options** while enforcing standardized formatting and validation rules.

---

## Features

### 1. Add Setting
- Accepts a key-value pair as a tuple.
- Converts both key and value to lowercase for consistency.
- Prevents duplicate settings from being added.
- Returns clear success or error messages.

### 2. Update Setting
- Updates existing settings safely.
- Validates that the setting exists before modification.
- Returns informative feedback messages.

### 3. Delete Setting
- Removes existing settings from the dictionary.
- Handles attempts to delete non-existing settings gracefully.

### 4. View Settings
- Displays all current user settings in a clean, structured format.
- Capitalizes setting names for improved readability.
- Returns a message if no settings are available.

## Technical Implementation
- Utilized **Python dictionaries** for efficient key-value storage.
- Designed modular functions for clean and reusable code.
- Applied conditional statements (`if`, `else`) for validation logic.
- Used string methods (`lower()`, `capitalize()`) for standardized formatting.
- Followed Pythonic best practices, including truth-value evaluation for empty dictionary checks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data structure manipulation (Dictionaries)
- Function design and modular programming
- Input normalization and validation
- Error handling and user-focused messaging
- Clean code principles
- Logical reasoning and problem-solving
